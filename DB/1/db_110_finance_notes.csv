Not sure how my information was provided, however I will advise Jeffrey that I will take over the claim so it won’t get delayed. I believe he is doing other tasks, so I do not want this one to sit much longer.

 09/18/2019 - recd email from HO  stating Thank you for reaching out and I greatly apologize for the delay in this matter. We have been really put in a spot with this invoice and it is no fault of yours. Do we have an option to try to pay this in portions a little at a time? Long story short, we feel someone else should pay for this, and to add to that the tarp was taken and thrown away by another roofing company. I understand this is not a Kruger issue, but any assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciate. Please let me know if I can start sending payments, as the rest of this process has drained us financially.
emailed ho back giving payment plan options w/lien & w/out lien waiting on his decision...
Option 1 – pay balance before Oct 20 – no lien
Balance of $1379.02
5 weekly installments of $275.80 starting 1st payment to be received Sept 20th – final payment to be received Oct 18th

spoke to tammi burns the adjuster for this claim, she advsd that there were additional repairs for $1141.00 + $2242.20 = $3383.20 - deductible of $2500.00 = $883.20 the amount paid directly the to the insured...she advsd we have to go after the insured for the remaining balance..advsd her that's not per our contract w/nexxus...she wasn't very happy and advsd that she'll have to look at it again to see if she missed something and let me know..i advsd her that it's only giving me 5 days for us to collect for our service... (by Cynthia) 
 12/03/2019 - recd email from tracey w/nexxus: I am reaching out again on this. However, I do show that the insured was paid off your estimate and the deductible was applied. However, it is not for the right amount. She received $883.66, leaving a balance owed on your estimate of  $1358.54. I am following up with Tammy because by my calculations, the covered portion would be $1301.00. I need to find out about the remaining balance owed. I will keep you posted. Thank you. (by Cynthia)

I will reach out to Tammi about the portion that she is  paying, however, the balance of $941.20 will need to be collected from the insured as there was no coverage for the tree removal. I will let you know what Tammi says about the 
balance owed from AIIC.  Additionally, the auditors at Nexxus will never be able to assist you with payment status. They are internal auditors at Nexxus only. Thank you. (by Cynthia)

 03/27/2020 - updated info in alacnet 
 Cynthia this file was closed.  When you have to do another aspect of this job you have to RR someone like you just did and ask fot he claim to be re-opened.  I see you have the invoice uploaded and PAS had money but didn't know what it was to.  You have to now open a supplemental job progress box, meaning a 2nd estimate in here so we can close it out and then you can get payment.

If you need help or you need me to walk you through you are free to call me.

02/01/2021 - spoke to the insured, he advsd he did not receive payment for the roof tarp--only for the mitigation...sent a note to xact cc olly/etc..Please note that it has been over 7 months since we've submitted our invoice for the roof tarp services. That does not give us any collection/lien rights to obtain payment from the insured. We've contacted the insured and they have advised that they have not received payment for our invoice. They have only received payment for the mitigation work.

We are requesting this to be escalated as payment should be sent directly to us or Sedgwick. Please advise as to when payment can be finalized for our invoice.

7/7/2021 recd email from Matt w/Rescue 911 stating: Hello Cynthia, 

I spoke to your office back when the tarp was originally completed and at first it was going to 
be an AOB through insurance. Then upon the insurance denial your office contacted me and advised me that 
insurance was a denial. Gus had told me the default price would be $1500 and I agreed and I assumed the 
invoice was paid by my office. Please send us the invoice so we can handle. Please speak to Michelle or Gus 
with any questions.  
Thank you! (by Cynthia)

03/11/2021 - EMAILED & MAILED OUT DEMAND LETTER ADVISING PAYMENT DUE BY 3/21/2021 OR COURTS
UPDATED ALACNET NOTES: FROM APRIL M MCMEANS: Reviewed Received estimate from Allstate- Alacrity (Kruger General Service) in the amount of $1,732.70 for Board up services. Per review of the updated Allstate estimate, damages exceeded insured's $4,400.00 deductible. Per review of the Allstate estimate, confirmed the following overlap:
(Allstate estimate)
Line item #55- R&R tarp- all purpose poly- per sq ft (labor and material)
Total overlap amounts to $924.00(program funds previously issued to insured by Allstate)
Therefore, vendor's estimate ($1,732.70) less overlap ($924.00) less prior payment to vendor ($766.68)= $42.02 owed to the vendor.
Issued supplement payment to the network in the amount of $42.02
**Notified IA/claim owner Karen Devine to discuss with insured that vendor will collect $924.00 for program services. (by Cynthia)

05/31/2022 - EMAILED LAWYER REQUESTING UPDATE ON SETTLEMENT AS IT'S BEEN 1 MONTH (by Cynthia) 
05/31/2022 - as per our lawyer Robert: We’re settled at $1,300.00.  Formalizing the settlement now and will circulate for both sides signatures.  I won’t be billing any additional time to your file. (by Cynthia) 
05/10/2022 -  (by Cynthia) 
05/10/2022 - RECD EMAIL FROM ROBERT ADVISING WE SETTLED AT $1300.00 & WILL NOT RECEIVE A BILL FOR ADD'L TIME.. (by Cynthia) 
04/27/2022 - WILL GET WITH MICHELLE AS OUR SIGNED AUTH IS 1 DAY LATER FROM DATE OF SERVICE.. 
RECD EMAIL FROM ATTORNEY W/SUGGESTION: As I informed you recently, we have a hearing coming up soon in this matter.  I think it may behoove us to settle before that time.  This attorney wants to fight this tooth and nail and I don’t necessarily feel confident in strength of our contract in this particular case based upon his arguments. Which would eliminate our chances of recovering attorneys fees in the event we are successful.  He previously made a settlement offer of $1,000.00, which I understand is not ideal.  But I think you may be better off cutting your losses on this particular case.  Please let me know your thoughts. (by Cynthia) 
04/20/2022 - RECD UPDATE FROM THE LAWYER: We have a hearing coming up within the next couple of weeks.  Will likely be the determining point of whether we settle or take it to trial on the merits.  I will keep you apprised as it approaches. (by Cynthia)

03/11/2022 - Added monthly Interest Fee due to non payment 1.5% October 2020 - March 2022. Updated Invoice $2,364.76 (by Ana Silva) 
02/16/2022 - EMAILED OUR LAWYER FOR UPDATE REGARDING COMMUNICATION W/HER LAWYER..
SENT INFO TO THE LAWYERS: Yes, so Gordon sold the property to a buyer (Red Oak Investment Co.) in December 2020.  Because the lien wasn't recorded yet, Red Oak didn't know about the dispute.  Then the lien was recorded in February 2021 and Red Oak never knew about it. Now, Red Oak is trying to sell the property to another buyer.  The title company being used for the transaction did a title search and found the lien.  It is preventing Red Oak from closing because they can't provide clear title to the new buyer.  That is why they threatened with a slander of title lawsuit.  
NOTES:8/20/2021 I just received a call from Kaleb w/AWS Title company regarding Mrs. Gordon’s property inquiring about the lien that we have on the property. Apparently, she’s trying to sell it, I advised him that we will not release the lien until we are paid in full. Here is Kaleb’s email address & phone number if you need to speak to him: kaleb@awstitle.com  813-908-6800 ext 8 or 210. (by Cynthia)

recd note from rob canty & stephanie in alacnet stating: The claim she called this in on is from 2017 and was denied back then. If this is new damage she needed to open a new claim. She supposedly has an attorney now. I can take care of this but we may need to wait to get her resolved on the existing claim. (by Cynthia)

02/12/2021 - recd reply from susan & leslie regarding payment status: Request for payment has been input and is pending approval for issuance.

added note in alacnet for payment status   I have reached out on this claim to the adjuster handling directly.  The claim number was wrong (claims start with 3300 and on file here it was listed as a number that began with H... have this now corrected).  I am thinking that is part of the problem as they would not have known who the paperwork was for as the claim number made no sense.  I will let you know when I hear back from the desk adjuster Leslie Anthony.  Thank you for brining this to our attention.  Kindly, Susan 866 953 3220 x3057 (by Cynthia)

recd email from insured advising she'll need a payment plan... (by Cynthia) 
 12/11/2020 - advsd insured: I understand your concern and we can work with you regarding payment-if you can pay immediately by 12/16/2020 we will reduce the invoice to $1000.00. If not, we can work out a payment plan (a lien will be placed for security until paid in full). Please let me know which option best suites you. 

recd email from insured...I attempted to call you back yesterday and left a voicemail.  I was told by my insurance company that you would be sending me an invoice.  I'm unsure why you were sending me to collections in the first place, when this is the first time anyone from your company has contacted me in reference to payment.  I will be more than happy to pay the bill, but it will definitely have to be under a payment plan, as I am a single mother and it is the holiday season.  I work this weekend and am to have my cell phone in the office (911 dispatch).  But you are more than welcome to email me.  Thank you! (by Cynthia)

02/12/2021 - susan added note to the adjsuter Gary: Just called and left Gary Johnson 954 489 8641 a voice message.  This estimate has never been paid.  There was a retarp done by VetCor in November and that has been paid but this original tarp work was submitted via email on 9/29 and is still showing open and unpaid in our records.  Please kindly give me a call back if there are any problems with getting this approved and payment arranged to our contractor who did this work.  Thank you, Susan 866 953 3220 x3057

recd response from note in alacnet from susan stating: hank you for reaching out.  It appears that this invoice was not received on the carrier side.  I have reached out to the adjuster and resent the estimate/invoice this morning for their review.  They did pay for a retarp in November but that is all that was paid to us.  I will let you know what I hear back.  The adjuster's name and phone are also listed in the loss information if you wish to reach out in a week or so as follow up, that would be okay.  Thanks again.

recd email from upc adjuster: I did receive your email. The FA included a tarp in his estimate for 800 Sq Ft in the amount of $806.78. I spoke with him and stated he added to the estimate because he knew a tarp was needed for a certain area. If you guys tarp the area, which it looks like the area has a tarp, that is fine. However, the insured will be responsible for paying that amount as I have already paid them. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. (by Cynthia)

ALACNET NOTES: FROM KRUGER:	Thank you for reaching out to the insured. We installed this tarp on the roof November 6, 2020. If you look at the photos, you can see that it was covered properly and sufficiently. No excessive tarping. If there were additional areas where it started leaking when it rained again, the insured did not make any attempt to make contact with us or Allstate to report there was additional leaking. We only covered the areas that had physical damaged (missing shingle and exposed decking). We could not justify additional tarping for 2 reasons. 1) no interior damage per the insured, 2) or additional damage area(s) on roof that we could justify additional tarping. The insured would not let the technicians inside as they stated they did not have any interior damage at the time, but they wanted it covered as a preventive measure. Please remember several storm impacted that area, so the tarp could have shifted causing water damage after excessive amounts of rain.
	 	 	The insured's email address is tharold88@gmail.com. The insured was notified on 02/17/21(IA spoke with the son Mr. Turner. Please see note below. Have you spoken with the insured since this note?
Called and spoke with the insured son Mr. Turner to inform him that he needs to pay the invoice for the emergency tarping and he claims the vendor did not install the tarp correct because water was still coming in to the home.

02/22/2021 - recd cc email from ben w/alacrity stating: It’s important to note this assignment is from 4 months ago when the tarp was installed in early November. This is a temp repair until the insured can make permanent repairs. The tarp is not meant to be permanent and last for several months as other weather events have occurred since November in the area. Sounds like the insured has never had permanent repairs made based on Carol’s communication with the insured yesterday and the tarp is still on the home. (by Cynthia)

03/26/2021 - Good Thursday Afternoon,
Per my voicemail a few minutes ago to you, I received an outstanding invoice from Kruger regarding the roof tarping service they performed on November 1st, 2020. The amount of this invoice is for $3,319.05. After research of your repair estimate, which is attached,  the roof tarp amount of $2,602.24 was included in a prior total payment to you and Mr. Crusel. 
On page 36 of your repair estimate -Line Item # 377. R&R Tarp - poly - w/sandbags - per sq ft (lab & mat) - 1,680.00 SF - $ 2,602.24
PURE will be issuing to Kruger a payment of $ 716.81. This payment was calculated as follows:
$ 3319.05 - Kruger Tarp Invoice 
( 2602.24) - less prior payment to Member
$ 716.81 - payment to Krueger

Kruger will be contacting you for the $2,602.24 balance.
Thank you for your understanding in this matter.
Respectively,
Randy Brantley (by Rachel)

12/13/2021 - 12/13 email to Christine elliott.I just got off the phone with one of your adjusters, Sherry, regarding the above referenced claim for Christopher Dailey.  She has advised that a check in the amount of 5,262.60 has been mailed to Nexxus two times and has been returned.  She would like to get us paid, but there are a few issues. She advised that the check is payable to Nexxus and the homeowner, and she cannot reissue to Kruger Disaster Recovery Team.  If she mailed the check to us, we would not be able to cash.    I spoke with Tina from Nexxus, and she advised that they don’t cash checks nor receive payments directly from UNA.  Are you able to contact the handling adjuster on this claim and try to get this check payable to Kruger General Services, Inc.? She is very eager to get this off her desk as we are very eager to receive payment.  Sherry's cell phone number is 251-442-5480 (by Michelle) 
12/08/2021 - Sherry Marshall with UNA called advising she got a check returned for this insured. Apparently Nexxus has moved locations.  We provided her with Brook's number 407-6308253 to work out how she is going to handle the check situation. She will let us know if she is going to send to us or Nexxus. (by Michelle)

01/06/2022 - lft msg for insured regarding payment as per TH they will not be paying on a flood claim..michelle has reached out the Jason Van Tol requesting assistance as we can't determine which claims are flood claims etc..
recd several emails/correspondence from Bob Canty/Hollie Huber etc: Hi Kruger and Alacrity – the DA has been clear. Tower Hill will not be paying for roof tarp on a flood claim. Please close out as we will not be addressing. **we have advised alacrirty/tower hill: This was a flood loss.  Why would you go and tarp the roof? We are not going to pay to tarp the roof due to rising water as 32"" of rising water will not cause damage to a roof.
  Jose,  this assignment was sent to Kruger on 08/17 CAT as follows: Cl# 3300381721, Insured: Frank Clements , Kruger Disaster Recovery Team (Board Up)
We only provide tarp and board up services not mitigation.
When we accepted the assignment, we contacted Mr. Clement who informed us that he had leaking in his living room and was in need of a roof tarp. Our findings were as follows: there was water damage found in the living room. The leaks are right by the sides of the chimney where the metal meets the blocks,  we had to wrap the chimney to prevent water intrusion.  What did we do wrong? 12/10/2021 12:15:54 PM (by Cynthia)

Emily,

I did review this file and it appears Jacob did include your invoice in the estimate to the insured. Payment was issued on the estimate to the insured for the invoice. If you would have any questions please reach out to Jacob as he is still the file handler. The check was issued to insured and it does show that it has been cleared by the insured. (by Cynthia)

He advised he has called his carrier and discovered a new adjuster has been assigned, her name is Beverly Slazik (877-234-4401 ext 4342). Walter advised he spoke with her on 1/18/22 and she has approved the invoice and has issued payment. Walter was not sure if it will go to him or to our office, he said it was for the full payment as well. He advised that it will take 7 days per his adjuster, he requested that if we do not have the check in the next 7 days to call him to let him know. That way we both can call the adjuster to obtain a quicker response. I sent an email to Cynthia about this. (by Kyle Bauer)

"10565","11/09/2021 - Emailed insured the invoice & called him..he advised - that Damian Marks advsd him that he's still working on the claim-waiting on roofing company-distrubting funds..advsd him to escalate this to  process payment directly to kruger.. he agreed...
update from Ben & Craig: Hi Craig, I don’t believe they have spoken to the insured since last week as he was quite upset last time Kruger called him about the payment.  
Cynthia, can you try calling the insured again on this one to collect payment of your invoice based on the info below from Craig? 
Thanks (by Cynthia)

12/22/2021 - recd message from Kyle: We received a call from Tenna at ASI around 11:30am while you were away from your desk. Teanna called into the office to see if the file has been paid. I advised Teanna we have not received payment on this file. Teanna mentioned that they issued payment directly to the insured and the insured is claiming more damages and wanted to talk about settling. When Teanna brought up settling, I advised that she needs to speak with you because I do not know about this process. Since you were away from your desk, I advised Teanna you will call her back at your earliest opportunity.

"28040","10/19/2021 - Thank you Ben. 
I called the 504-376-9523-she advised she’s in the doctors office, she received the email from Allstate & requested I call her back in 1 hour & disconnected the call. 
I’ll keep you posted 😊 (by Cynthia) 
10/19/2021 - I’ve tried to call the insured 2 times and the mailbox is full/can not leave any messages. We mailed out a letter to the insured advising remaining balance was due. Do you have another contact phone # for Mrs. Cuzzort and/or email address? (by Cynthia) 
10/18/2021 - LAST DAY TO LIEN 11/13
MAILED OUT LETTER TO INSURED ADVISING OF PARTIAL PAYMENT..RB DUE BY INSURED..EMAILED INFO TO BEN AS WELL.. 
ALACRITY NOTES: 	Reviewed I have received estimate from Allstate-Alacrity(Kruger General Service) in the amount of $411.99 for Board Up. There is coverage and all of the deductible except $329.28 has been deducted. There is no overlap. Therefore, vendor’s estimate ($411.99) Amount vendor is to bill the insured ($329.28) Amount Allstate paid to the vendor ($82.71).


Thank you!

RECD EMAIL FROM A BEN (RECTOR@HOLYTRINITYWENOUAH.ORG) ADVISING: To whom it may concern,
We recently sent you a check for $2029.41 for invoice 8903 for claim 43393. The check was signed (accidentally) by someone who is a not a signer on the account and there is a chance that it could bounce.
We are asking that you don't cash the check until we can get the issue with the signers worked out and make sure we send you a good check.
Sorry for any inconvenience. Please let me know if you have any questions.

05/31/2022 - Michelle emailed Diana w/preferred: Hello Diana, 
We do not obtain a Kruger Work Authorization on any job remitted to us from PRN, therefore we do not have any legal right to pursue collections.
Can you please review this file for payment. 

sent the info to Michelle-as we don't obtain their WA - we have no legal ground..
recd email from diana w/preferred: I wanted to loop you in to this email. Please reach out to the customer once again. from jennifer langley w/sf jlangley@pmains.com: We didn’t pay any vendor for any work. We received the field adjuster’s estimate which came back as $36,007.78 RCV. The insured has a limit of $34,800.00. A check was cut for that limit the morning of 10/5/2021. I’m not sure why the insured is indicating that she didn’t know she needed to pay this amount. The contract that she signed has a clause indicating that “the insured and undersigned will be responsible for payment regardless of insurance coverage or payments.” Even on the Certificate of Satisfaction portion of the contract, it states that “I/We further understand and agree that the deductible, if not already satisfied, is my/our responsibility to pay, as is the cost of any services which are not covered by insurance.”

Looking in my file, I see that we requested a payment for this invoice, but it was denied by management because the policy limits were already reached. There is nothing that we are able to do further for this. (by Cynthia)

Good afternoon.  My name is Sal Brocato.  I represent Ms. Hart regarding her claims against SF.  I have been trying to get in contact with someone on this account.  As you know, SF hired your company to handle the tarping on her home.  However, they issued payment to me, my client, you and her mortgage company.  We can not negotiate the check.  Therefore, we can not send payment for services.  
 
Please contact me to discuss.
 
Thanks

Jim, I am in receipt of the checks.  I am a bit confused as to why the Alacrity and Kruger checks were sent to me.  I understood they were hired by SF.  I may be wrong. Either way, please send me invoices you have in your possession reflecting these amounts.

Content:
Cynthia, I'm not sure you need to upload anything to XA or AlacNet as the XA assignment was cancelled by Allstate. I don't think you can upload the estimate now on your end in XA. I would just bill the insured at this point and we can cancel the assignment here in AlacNet so you are not charged any fees by us. This one is strange so if insured doesn't pay you I can escalate to Allstate as they made the mistake sending us the assignment on the front end. Let me know your thoughts. 

recd email from Ben w/alacrity-allstate: Content:
Cynthia, per notes it appears this assignment got cancelled by Allstate a day after sending to us because it's a flood claim and was sent in error. You noted you completed the tarping already though by the time they alerted us of the cancellation. I suspect Allstate will advise you need to collect from insured. Any idea the amount of your tarping invoice or have you tried contacting insured about payment? (by Cynthia)

Hello,
I received this message today. Unfortunately I cannot open the line and there is no attachment so I am not 100% sure what invoice you are referring too.  I did look and it look like there is an invoice in the file and we sent a check to the claimant on 12/07/21 for Tarp/Temporary repairs.   The claimant was sent a letter on 11/29/2021 letting them know a check was coming for them to pay Krueger Disaster Recovery (by Cynthia)

01/19/2022 - Mrs Duncan called because she received the letter with the unpaid invoices 9841 & 10040. She will reach out to the adjuster and also call us back to provide us with the info.

01/19/2022 - Mrs Duncan called because she received the letter with the unpaid invoices 9841 & 10040. She will reach out to the adjuster and also call us back to provide us with the info. However, she was upset that we charged her a second invoice for the repair when it was less than 30 days. I explained that it was due to high winds thats the reason why the tarp shifted. She still argued about no high winds in LA after that. I told her we will get back with her. (by Ana Silva)

Payment was issued to Sedgwick on March 11, 2022 per manager’s notes.  It states for Kruger to please reach out to ask that Sedgwick that the payment be forwarded from Sedgwick and revise their estimate to remove the $900.00 tarp fee.
Sincerely, 
Shannon Baker (by Cynthia)

01/25/2022 - John Mann (HO) called into the office on Tuesday (1/25/22) at 3:13pm because he received the final billing letter. HO wanted to know why his bill was around $4,800 and if his insurance carrier (UPC) doesn’t pay is he responsible for payment. I explained to the HO that the price of the Roof Tarp is based off a set price list that is set by his insurance carrier in which we are required to use. I informed the HO that if his insurance carrier didn’t pay than he is responsible for payment. I also explained to the HO that we are not trying to collect any payment from him at this time, I explained that all HO’s get this letter to inform them payment was sent to the carrier and request their assistance with following up with the carrier to issue payment. I explained to the HO that we follow up with the carrier as well, but if we work at it together payment can be issued faster. The HO was a little upset and asked if his bill can be negotiated. The HO mention that his insurance carrier (UPC) hasn’t been covering his claims recently. I let the HO know that request will need to be sent to our management team, I recommend he follow up with his carrier and adjuster first. The HO agreed but believes they will not pay. The HO also mentioned that everyone around him that had Roof Tarps installed was done for $500. I explained to the HO I understand the bill is not cheap, but this price list is set by your insurance carrier, and we do not have control over that. The HO advised he will follow up with his adjuster/carrier about payment status. (by Kyle Bauer)

We just received a call from the insured, confirming payment was issued to him. He’ll be mailing out the check this week for our invoice. He also advised that the roof was inspected yesterday by a roofing company & they did have to pull back some areas of the tarp. 
Please let us know if we need to go out to reset the tarp to assure its secured properly. (by Cynthia)

I spoke with Emily w/customer service who advised me that it looks like payment for our roof tarp was mailed to directly to the insured on 3/9/2022. Can you please advise if this true, as normally payments go directly to us or Nexxus? I was also advised that the claim is still open and there will be a roof inspection. We did not receive an assignment to go out and reset the tarp after the inspection

Multiple copies of your invoice have been received. There is no need to continue submitting them. Please do not make any further inquiries regarding when the claim will be paid. There are thousands of claims that Lighthouse abandoned when they filed for bankruptcy. We are working as quickly as we can to get claims processed but it is taking some time.

04/15/2022 - We are waiting for the insured to sign and return the WA. Nadal/Gus thought this was an SECC job, and advised Jatisel the tarp can be installed. I worked with Nadal/Gus on this one and updated PRN that we did stop by the property, but the HO was not home or returning our calls. We installed a small tarp (roughly 8x8) and emailed the HO the WA. I explained to PRN we decided to install it since we were in the area, but thunderstorms are suppose to hit the area this weekend. To prevent more damage we installed the tarp and emailed the WA to the HO. PRN has been made aware that a tarp was installed, the WA was emailed to the HO, another message was left to the HO advising to sign WA an the tarp was installed. (by Kyle Bauer)
