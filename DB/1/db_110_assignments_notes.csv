"9","** see below from Mike**
Leak detection was out at the home this morning and determined the source to be a roof leak. I spoke
to the internal examiner Scott at Security First who would like us to tarp the roof. He would also like us
to send out a mold estimator to inspect. If we think there is more than 10sq ft of mold and remediation
is required. He would like us to call him at his direct number 386-523-2306 so he can approve mold
testing if our estimator thinks that it is necessary.
It should also be noted that the insured just finished a three year long lawsuit; with a company who had
done mold work in her home previously. She is extremely concerned about mold and wants someone
out right away."

Furthermore, remove the existing tarp and put the tarp over the entire entire portion of the home all the way to the perimeter using furring strips and sandbags only. Do not leave three or four sections of tile exposed.

Take lots of photos, before and after.

This is a reminder that GHD is scheduled for inspection at the Ramirez residence tomorrow at 11am with our expert Jessica Serota performing the inspection. It is imperative that the tarp already be removed prior to our arrival at our scheduled time of 11am. If tarp is still on the roof when our expert arrives they will have to leave and appointment will be rescheduled for a later date. It is advised that if it is a tarp removal company is going out to remove the tarp they do so PRIOR to our 11am appointment as we have other appointments to follow.

I understand it is hard to place tarps when unable to visually see locations from the interior. The homeowner said that if tarps are placed above bathroom and garage that he would like if the vents are not completely covered. Can you help me out with this one please? Thanks

If you are not available please let me know your dates of availability. After tomorrow, I am not available until next week. Mr. Metz is wanting to make roof repairs asap. Thank you.

"7364","03/23/2021 - Declined job. After speaking with the insured, he informed us there is nothing to board up, as this is a total loss.  He did not feel it was necessary for us to come out.  We will not mobilize a team if services are declined.  We then requested photos so we can take a look at the loss site and determine if there is anything we can assist with on the property such as windows or doors. After reviewing the photos, of the roof and the side of the house that is missing, there is no structure left where we can secure/adhere the plywood to the home to cover the area. Our recommendation is to dispatch a  contactor who rebuild the structure on the side of the home and the exposed roof, as this is beyond our EMS technician's expertise. (by Michelle)
03/23/2021 - 03/23 Attached you will find a photo sheet of the damages to the insured's home.  The hole in the roof is too large to build anything with plywood that will safely protect the home without collapsing.   Even if a tarp is placed on the roof, it will sink in.  Based on the information provided, we are unable to provide board up services to this home.  We are withdrawing this claim. (by Michelle)

Paul said that there is a maor leak in the roof of his house. The ceiling tile caved in in one of the closets upstairs. Someone came by and tarped it up for him and he fixed as much of inside the closet as he could. But then when he opened the garage door a bunch of water spilled out and he isn't sure what to do. He has pictures of everything for files. Please call back with assistance, he has bad hearing and he has a TTY phone that allows him to read phone calls. So call his home phone, it tells him who is calling and he will call you back. Thank you. (by Cynthia)"

"9045","09/01/2021 - I signed an agreement yesterday with your company, Kruger Disaster Recovery to install an emergency tarp on my home (address referenced above in subject line).  The agreement with Kruger Disaster Recovery gives me 3 days to cancel my contract... that gives me until Friday 9/3/2021, so I am officially cancelling my contract effective today 9/1/2021 at 1:30pm CDT.

I appreciate your efforts, I just cannot wait any longer for a tarp and have been unsuccessful reaching anyone at Kruger to give me an update.  I have someone who is ready to put up a tarp now so I have decided to cancel my agreement with Kruger.

Sorry for any inconvenience.  I will notify the insurance company of my decision (UPC Insurance).  Please feel free to call me at 504-329-6462 if you need anything else.

09/30/2021 - **RECD APPROVAL FROM ANDREW TO REPLACE EXISTING TARP IF IT'S NAILED DOWN-IF IT JUST HAS SANDBAGS THEN TAKE PHOTOS OF BEFORE AND AFTER PLUS THE DAMAGE UNDER THE TARP**
Good morning, PRN sent this claim over to Kruger for the tarp to be detached and photographed, then to reset the tarp. 
If the existing tarp is nailed down, then there will likely be a new tarp invoice from you. If the existing tarp has sand bags, then please take photos of the before and after plus the damage under the tarp.
The reason this assignment exists is to document and photograph the damage underneath the tarp currently installed. 
Please reach out to me directly if you have any questions or concerns regarding if you have approval/etc.
This claim has escalated as the insured has not yet been contacted and this is from several days ago.
Please call this insured as soon as you can. Thanks so much Kruger/Augusto!

After speaking with Brandon, we noticed the roof tarp may need to be replaced as the roof tarp will be over 90 days old at the requested date for the service. I left Brandon a message and sent an email advising him of this and that if we would bill Top Notch it would be $1,600, we would bill him directly after job is completed and I would add this to the schedule today. 

The attorney price would be $2,322.50 which we need up front, if the roof tarp did not need to be replaced it would be $650.00 and we would refund the attorney. I advised Brandon that he needs to relay this to the attorney and if they are okay with the price they are to email us and we will collect payment info, run payment and once it went through than add it to our schedule.
